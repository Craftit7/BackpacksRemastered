# Proof of concepts (POCs)

These files are snippets of proof-of-concept code for possible features/things to add in later 
versions. They are heavily annotated with notes about what they are trying to do and for what reason.
Most are abstract, only showing a base functionality that is required for the idea that is being proven
to be implemented. They may also have accompanying resources.
